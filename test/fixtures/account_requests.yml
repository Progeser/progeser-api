  comment: Good evening, London. Allow me first to apologize for this interruption.
    I do, like many of you, appreciate the comforts of every day routine- the security
    of the familiar, the tranquility of repetition. I enjoy them as much as any bloke.
    But in the spirit of commemoration, whereby those important events of the past,
    usually associated with someone's death or the end of some awful bloody struggle,
    a celebration of a nice holiday, I thought we could mark this November the 5th,
    a day that is sadly no longer remembered, by taking some time out of our daily
    lives to sit down and have a little chat. There are of course those who do not
    want us to speak. I suspect even now, orders are being shouted into telephones,
    and men with guns will soon be on their way. Why? Because while the truncheon
    may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power. Words
    offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of
    truth. And the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country,
    isn't there? Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once
    you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have
    censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and soliciting your
    submission. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well certainly there are those
    more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable, but again truth
    be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror. I
    know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease.
    There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob
    you of your common sense. Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned
    to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler. He promised you order, he promised you
    peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent. Last night
    I sought to end that silence. Last night I destroyed the Old Bailey, to remind
    this country of what it has forgotten. More than four hundred years ago a great
    citizen wished to embed the fifth of November forever in our memory. His hope
    was to remind the world that fairness, justice, and freedom are more than words,
    they are perspectives. So if you've seen nothing, if the crimes of this government
    remain unknown to you, then I would suggest you allow the fifth of November to
    pass unmarked. But if you see what I see, if you feel as I feel, and if you would
    seek as I seek, then I ask you to stand beside me one year from tonight, outside
    the gates of Parliament, and together we shall give them a fifth of November that
    shall never, ever be forgot.

  comment: I know there's no way I can convince you this is not one of their tricks,
    but I don't care, I am me. My name is Valerie, I don't think I'll live much longer
    and I wanted to tell someone about my life. This is the only autobiography I'll
    ever write, and god, I'm writing it on toilet paper. I was born in Nottingham
    in 1985, I don't remember much of those early years, but I do remember the rain.
    My grandmother owned a farm in Tuttlebrook, and she use to tell me that god was
    in the rain. I passed my 11th lesson into girl's grammar; it was at school that
    I met my first girlfriend, her name was Sara. It was her wrists. They were beautiful.
    I thought we would love each other forever. I remember our teacher telling us
    that is was an adolescent phase people outgrew. Sara did, I didn't. In 2002, I
    fell in love with a girl named Christina. That year I came out to my parents.
    I couldn't have done it without Chris holding my hand. My father wouldn't look
    at me, he told me to go and never come back. My mother said nothing. But I had
    only told them the truth, was that so selfish? Our integrity sells for so little,
    but it is all we really have. It is the very last inch of us, but within that
    inch, we are free. I'd always known what I wanted to do with my life, and in 2015
    I starred in my first film, 'The Salt Flats'. It was the most important role of
    my life, not because of my career, but because that was how I met Ruth. The first
    time we kissed, I knew I never wanted to kiss any other lips but hers again. We
    moved to a small flat in London together. She grew Scarlet Carsons for me in our
    window box, and our place always smelled of roses. Those were there best years
    of my life. But America's war grew worse, and worse. And eventually came to London.
    After that there were no roses anymore. Not for anyone. I remember how the meaning
    of words began to change. How unfamiliar words like 'collateral' and 'rendition'
    became frightening. While things like Norse Fire and The Articles of Allegiance
    became powerful, I remember how different became dangerous. I still don't understand
    it, why they hate us so much. They took Ruth while she was out buying food. I've
    never cried so hard in my life. It wasn't long till they came for me. It seems
    strange that my life should end in such a terrible place, but for three years,
    I had roses, and apologized to no one. I shall die here. Every inch of me shall
    perish. Every inch, but one. An Inch, it is small and it is fragile, but it is
    the only thing the world worth having. We must never lose it or give it away.
    We must never let them take it from us. I hope that whoever you are, you escape
    this place. I hope that the world turns and that things get better. But what I
    hope most of all is that you understand what I mean when I tell you that even
    though I do not know you, and even though I may never meet you, laugh with you,
    cry with you, or kiss you. I love you. With all my heart, I love you. -Valerie

  comment: 'My fellow Englishmen: tonight our country, that which we stand for, and
    all we hold dear, faces a grave and terrible threat. This violent and unparalleled
    assault on our security will not go undefended... or unpunished. Our enemy is
    an insidious one, seeking to divide us and destroy the very foundation of our
    great nation. Tonight, we must remain steadfast. We must remain determined. But
    most of all, we must remain united. Those caught tonight in violation of curfew
    will be considered in league with our enemy and prosecuted as a terrorist without
    leniency or exception. Tonight, I give you my most solemn vow: that justice will
    be swift, it will be righteous, and it will be without mercy.'
